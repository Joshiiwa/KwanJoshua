<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px;">After burying the hatchet in Daddy's Home (2015), the stepfather with a heart of gold, Brad, and the kids' biological dad with the perfect six-pack, Dusty, are now proud co-dads, working in unison to care for Megan and Dylan. This year, with Christmas just around the corner, the once-incompatible parents and their families decide to spend the holidays together; however, things will take a turn for the unexpected when Dusty's alpha-dad, Kurt, and Brad's touchy-feely father, Don, decide to pay a visit. Now--as the merry holidaymakers end up in a snow-capped cabin for a week--it seems that there's no escape from an impending Yuletide disaster unless the two pairs of fathers learn how to coexist and work together for the sake of the kids. Will things work out in the end? Can the four daddies save Christmas?</p>
