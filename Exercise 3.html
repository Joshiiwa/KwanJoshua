<h1 style="color: white;">Computer-based artificial intelligence can function more like human intelligence when programmed to use a much faster technique for learning new objects, say two neuroscientists who designed such a model that was designed to mirror human visual learning.</h1>
<pre style="font-size: 11pt;color: white;">
     In the journal Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience, Maximilian Riesenhuber, 
     PhD, professor of neuroscience, at Georgetown University Medical Center, and Joshua Rule, PhD, 
     a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley, explain how the new approach vastly improves the 
     ability of AI software to quickly learn new visual concepts.
    
     "Our model provides a biologically plausible way for artificial neural networks 
     to learn new visual concepts from a small number of examples," says Riesenhuber. 
     "We can get computers to learn much better from few examples by leveraging prior 
     learning in a way that we think mirrors what the brain is doing."

     Humans can quickly and accurately learn new visual concepts from sparse data
     Â¬- sometimes just a single example. Even three- to four-month-old babies can 
     easily learn to recognize zebras and distinguish them from cats, horses, and 
     giraffes. But computers typically need to "see" many examples of the same object 
     to know what it is, Riesenhuber explains.

     The big change needed was in designing software to identify relationships 
     between entire visual categories, instead of trying the more standard approach 
     of identifying an object using only low-level and intermediate information, 
     such as shape and color, Riesenhuber says.

     "The computational power of the brain's hierarchy lies in the potential 
     to simplify learning by leveraging previously learned representations from
     a databank, as it were, full of concepts about objects," he says.

     Riesenhuber and Rule found that artificial neural networks, which represent
     objects in terms of previously learned concepts, learned new visual concepts
     significantly faster.

     Rule explains, "Rather than learn high-level concepts in terms of 
     low-level visual features, our approach explains them in terms of
     other high-level concepts. It is like saying that a platypus looks 
     a bit like a duck, a beaver, and a sea otter."

     The brain architecture underlying human visual concept learning builds 
     on the neural networks involved in object recognition. The anterior 
     temporal lobe of the brain is thought to contain "abstract" concept 
     representations that go beyond shape. These complex neural hierarchies
     for visual recognition allow humans to learn new tasks and, crucially,
     leverage prior learning.

     "By reusing these concepts, you can more easily learn new concepts, 
     new meaning, such as the fact that a zebra is simply a horse of a 
     different stripe," Riesenhuber says.

     Despite advances in AI, the human visual system is still the 
     gold standard in terms of ability to generalize from few examples, 
     robustly deal with image variations, and comprehend scenes, 
     the scientists say.

     "Our findings not only suggest techniques that could help 
     computers learn more quickly and efficiently, they can also 
     lead to improved neuroscience experiments aimed at understanding 
     how people learn so quickly, which is not yet well understood,
     "Riesenhuber concludes.
